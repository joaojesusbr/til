# Adding a Placeholder Attribute to an Input Element

The placeholder is an attribute that adds a standard text to our input in order to signal the user what kind of information he should enter in the field.

Let's add the placeholder attribute directly to the tag:

```html
<input type="email" placeholder="Your Email">
```
